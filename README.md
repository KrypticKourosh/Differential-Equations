Built with SymPy library <br>
This program can compute the Taylor series's answer for the desired function of your choice for a certain point. <br>
Ex) Solve the differential equation using the Taylor series method, if: <br>
  y = f(x) <br>
  y' = x - y^2 <br>
  y(1) = 1 <br>
Compute y(1.2) using 4 terms of the series. <br>
Solution: 1.01733 <br>
