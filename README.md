Built with SymPy library <br>
This program can compute the Taylor series's answer for the given function of your choice. <br>
The Example used here: <br>
Solve the differential equation using the Taylor series method, if: <br>
  y = f(x) <br>
  y' = x - y^2 <br>
  y(1) = 1 <br>
Compute y(1.2) using 4 terms of the series. <br>
